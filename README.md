# The Gower distance

Gower distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two objects in a dataset. It is commonly used in cluster analysis and other machine learning applications to compare the similarity between pairs of objects. Gower distance can be used with mixed data types, such as continuous, binary, and categorical variables, making it a versatile measure of dissimilarity.

The formula for calculating the Gower distance between two objects i and j is:

Gower(i, j) = 1 - (sum_k w_k * d_k(i, j)) / sum_k w_k

where w_k is the weight associated with variable k, and d_k(i, j) is the distance between the values of variable k for objects i and j. The denominator ensures that the Gower distance is scaled to fall between 0 and 1.

The Gower distance is a useful metric because it can handle data with different scales and types. For example, it can handle categorical variables by converting them into binary variables, where each category is assigned a binary value. It can also handle continuous variables by calculating the absolute difference between the values of the variables for each object.

To calculate the Gower distance in R with the "cluster" package, you can use the "daisy" function. The "daisy" function calculates the dissimilarity matrix for a set of observations based on various distance measures, including the Gower distance.

Here is an example code snippet that shows how to calculate the Gower distance for a dataset using the "daisy" function. In this example, the "patiens" dataset is used, which is a sample dataset created by me. 

Due to the ratio and ordinal scale nature of the blood pressure and pain level variables in dataset, they need to be converted to z-scores. The sex variable can be coded as 1 for males and 0 for females, or vice versa. This is because there is no difference in importance between the classes of this variable, meaning that symmetry is present. For binary variables, other values that denote two conditions can also be used. For example, in this study, males were coded as M and females as F. The other variables (test1,test2 and test3) in the dataset are asymmetric binary variables. This is because a positive result of any test is more important than a negative one. In this dataset, positive results were coded as Positive and negative results as Negative.
